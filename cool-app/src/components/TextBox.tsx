            <div>I am a full stack developer and programmer currently working in higher education.
            I have experiences creating full stack Java applications and REST API to be used by students and faculty. I also have experience working with Oracle SQL and T-SQL database.
            Before becoming a software engineer, I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park
            and worked in the accounting consulting field for about 3 years. My experiences working closely
            with data scientists and other technical developers during my time as a consultant opened my
            eyes to the world of coding and software developing.</div>
